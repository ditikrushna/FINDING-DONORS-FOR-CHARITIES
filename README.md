# Discrete-Optimization


 - [ ] Week 1  [The Knapsack Problem]
    - [x] Greddy Algorithm Overview **[Lecture - 1]**
       - For one problem ,there are many possible greedy algorithms .
       - depends on the input! 
       - quick to design and implement 
       - can be very fast 
       - no quality guarantees (in general)
       - quality can vary widely on the input 
       - problem feasibility needs to be "easy"  
    - [x] Optimization Models **[Lecture - 2]**
       - How to model an optimization Problem 
    - [x] Dynamic Programming **[Lecture - 3]**
       - Widely used optimization technique 
		    - for certain classes of problems 
		    - heavily used in computational biology 
       - Basic principle 
		   - divide and conquer 
		   - bottom up computation 
        - The algorithm is in fact exponential in terms of the input size.
