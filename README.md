    - [x] Greddy Algorithm Overview **[Lecture - 1]**
       - For one problem ,there are many possible greedy algorithms .
       - depends on the input! 
			    - quick to design and implement 
			    - can be very fast 
			    - no quality guarantees (in general)
			    - quality can vary widely on the input 
			    - problem feasibility needs to be "easy"
