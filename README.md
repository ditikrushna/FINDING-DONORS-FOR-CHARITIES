 - [ ] Week 1  
    - [x] Greddy Algorithm Overview **[Lecture - 1]**
       - For one problem ,there are many possible greedy algorithms .
       - depends on the input! 
       - quick to design and implement 
       - can be very fast 
       - no quality guarantees (in general)
       - quality can vary widely on the input 
       - problem feasibility needs to be "easy"  
    - [x] Optimization Models **[Lecture - 2]**
       - How model an optimization Problem
